Find out what’s changing for our 2023 convention as we work on finalizing details for our November launch.</p><h2>Registration</h2><p class="">Our registration is currently scheduled to open on November 1st, with early bird pricing until January 29th, 2023! There are several important changes to our registration policies for 2023. Here’s a high-level overview of the changes, with more details to come:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>You must be registered for Anthrocon in order to reserve an Anthrocon-block hotel room</strong>, with room blocks starting in late January based on registration tier. For those who register before January 30th, an email will be sent out to registered attendee’s emails (depending on their tier). If you register afterwards, the link needed to reserve a hotel room will be included in the confirmation email from your registration.</p></li><li><p class="">Registration will <strong>close temporarily between January 30th and February 2nd</strong> to allow for advance hotel booking to happen for Supersponsors and Ultrasponsors. Pre-registration will resume daytime on February 2nd in time for general hotel block booking.</p></li><li><p class="">Both <strong>Supersponsor </strong>and <strong>Ultrasponsor </strong>tiers will <strong>only be available during online pre-registration, </strong>which ends on June 11th, 2023. You will NOT be able to purchase these tiers on-site due to limited quantities of perks/benefits.</p></li><li><p class="">We will be updating our <a href="https://www.anthrocon.org/refundpolicy"><strong>Refund Policy page</strong></a> to reflect our 2023 Registration updates. The most important update is a clarification on our refund policy for Sponsor, Supersponsor, and Ultrasponsor tiers regarding what constitutes a non-refundable “donation” based on level of membership. In addition, we have clarified rules regarding refunds that are tied to hotel bookings.</p></li></ul><p class="">While we continue to finalize updates to pricing and policy, you can find examples of what pricing and perks could look like on our <a href="https://www.anthrocon.org/registration"><strong>2022 Registration page</strong></a>. The page will be updated with 2023 information a week before opening.</p><h2>Dealers Room Applications</h2><p class="">Applications to be a vendor at Anthrocon 2023 will open simultaneously with pre-registration. However, please note that there are also changes to the Dealers Room policies and process.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Dealers can apply through the same form as online pre-registration, including upgrading your membership. However, you will still need to be approved and confirmed for a Dealer’s spot. All dealers will be approved in time for hotel room reservations in late January, and a separate hotel block will be made available to approved dealers.</p></li><li><p class="">The <a href="https://www.anthrocon.org/drip"><strong>Dealers Room Information Packet</strong> </a>for Dealers will be updated for 2023 by the time applications open. These will include important changes including insurance policy clarifications for all vendors, and updated vendor fees. </p></li></ul><h2>Panels &amp; Events Applications</h2><p class="">We will be renaming the Programming department to Events! With that, we’ll be looking to open applications for hosting a panel or event at Anthrocon 2023 starting November 1st and closing on March 15, 2023. More details about panel/event rules and guidelines will be updated closer to the opening date on <a href="https://www.anthrocon.org/programming"><strong>our Programming page</strong></a>.</p><h2>Volunteers &amp; Staff Signups</h2><p class="">We know there are many folks interested in learning what it’s like to put on a convention, and we’d love to grow our team! We will have more information regarding volunteer and staff opportunities with our team coming in the next months. If you volunteered last year, you’ll be hearing from our Volunteers team soon regarding interest for 2023. </p><h2>Social Media and Telegram Announcements</h2><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Don’t forget to join our Telegram Announcement group for all important announcements - handy for when your timelines are filled with #FursuitFriday posts. You can find the new channel by searching @Anthrocon on Telegram, or <a href="https://t.me/Anthrocon"><strong>this official Telegram link</strong></a>.</p></li><li><p class="">As always, we will continue to provide as many updates as possible on our website and social media. Make sure you follow us on our<strong> </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/anthrocon" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter </strong></a>and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Anthrocon" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook</strong> </a>for the latest updates.</p></li></ul>

We’re sharing some tips to help you cover the basics of what to do before the convention so you’re well prepared for a weekend in Pittsburgh.</p><h3>1) Get your COVID and Registration Documents</h3><p class=""><strong>Remember that with this year’s</strong> <a href="https://www.anthrocon.org/covidpolicy"><strong>COVID policy</strong></a>, you’ll need to have one of our accepted documentations to get your registration: a digital or physical proof of full vaccination with approved vaccines, or a certified negative COVID test from a proctored test (not a home test kit). <strong>If you’re showing a test, make sure it’s within the timeframe allowed</strong> - one day for antigen tests, and three days for PCR tests.</p><p class=""><strong>To pick up your badge</strong>, you’ll need your government-issued photo ID (such as a driver’s license or passport) with your name and date of birth. <strong>If you’re a minor (under 18) and unaccompanied by parent</strong>, make sure you have your <a href="https://www.anthrocon.org/s/minor-consent-2022-cfbz.pdf"><strong>Minor Consent form</strong></a> <strong>filled out and notarized</strong> to show at Registration. Make sure you’ve got everything handy to help speed up the process!</p><h3>2) Learn what’s changed for 2022</h3><p class=""><strong>Read up on the changes</strong> to locations that you may be familiar with for things such as Registration, which is now in Hall E and accessed from the street-level. We’ve provided a summary of these changes on our <a href="https://www.anthrocon.org/planning-your-arrival"><strong>Planning Your Arrival page</strong></a>.</p><h3>3) plan your travel (and backup plans)</h3><p class=""><strong>If you’re arriving by car</strong>, make sure to plan your routes and stops ahead of time to ensure you’ll have areas to rest, re-fuel, and get assistance if needed. <strong>If you’re flying into Pittsburgh</strong>, make sure you stay informed of your local airport and airline’s travel conditions as you may encounter delays and/or cancellations due to various reasons. Don’t forget our other travel tips on <a href="https://www.anthrocon.org/travel"><strong>our Travel page</strong></a>.</p><h3>4) Confirm your rooming arrangements</h3><p class=""><strong>Double-check your booking details before you arrive</strong> so you know when your check-in time is. If you’re planning to room with someone else, whether you’re familiar with them or not, make sure you have all the details that you’ll need to check in and/or get a room key. The last thing you’ll want is to arrive with all your belongings, and no room to put them in. </p><h3>5) Ensure you’ve got ways to pay </h3><p class=""><strong>Check that you’ve got enough cash or ways to pay for things</strong>, such as a bank or credit card (and with funds on them). There are ATMs and local banks in the immediate convention area if you need more cash while at the convention. For those looking to conserve their spending, try and budget for at least two solid meals a day - the most important part of your convention spending! </p><h3>6) Check your packing</h3><p class=""><strong>Make a packing list and double-check everything</strong> so you don’t forget to bring something important to the con. Realizing you left something at home can make you feel pretty bad, or in some cases, make the convention difficult to enjoy. </p><h3>7) Make a schedule</h3><p class=""><strong>Make a handy schedule</strong> with all the places and events you want to see at the convention, whether it’s through the <a href="https://anthrocon2022.sched.com" target="_blank"><strong>official Sched application</strong> </a>or with your own planning method. It’ll save you time and stress doing it at the convention.</p><h3>8) Familiarize with Pittsburgh’s local area</h3><p class=""><strong>Learn what’s nearby the convention center and your hotel</strong>, such as where the nearest pharmacy or bank is, so you won’t be wondering where to pick up that toothpaste you forgot to pack (see tip #6!). A great place to start is by looking at what’s near the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LNUxJ21DnsNCy2YbA" target="_blank"><strong>David L. Lawrence Convention Center</strong></a>.</p><h3>9) Follow Anthrocon's official update channels</h3><p class=""><strong>Follow our main announcement channels for Anthrocon</strong>, which are primarily through <a href="https://twitter.com/anthrocon" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter</strong> </a>and <a href="https://t.me/anthrocon" target="_blank"><strong>Telegram</strong></a>. Throughout the convention, we’ll be sharing important updates and changes through these channels, but they will not be the only source of information. Refer to our online schedule for panel times, and our website for other details.</p><h3>10) Share these tips with your friends</h3><p class=""><strong>Spread these tips around to those that you know are going to Anthrocon</strong>, and help them with their preparation! Nothing’s better than knowing you helped a friend with their convention experience. Well, maybe except for getting a hug from them as thanks.</p><p class="">—</p><p class=""><a href="https://flic.kr/p/WDTP8C" target="_blank"><em>Banner photo by Randorn</em></a></p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59d2e7962994ca6597e2795c/1655261013670-118U0IBZFTPHZO4WB1DG/35872085086_79f4043e13_k_Randorn.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="973"><media:title type="plain">Anthrocon 2022: 10 Tips Before You Get Here</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Anthrocon 2022: It's Almost Here!</title><dc:creator>Ronnie Noodles</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 15:55:27 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.anthrocon.org/news/2022/6/10/anthrocon-2022-its-almost-here</link><guid isPermaLink="false">59d2e7962994ca6597e2795c:59d2f8971f318d87163c5ecb:625f0e0c9f6da615f7b86a09</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class=""><em>3 minute read</em></p><p class="">After three long years, the buzz of excitement in the air is palpable!

Lawrence Convention Center, and with VisitPittsburgh throughout the year as we have been monitoring the situation with COVID-19.&nbsp; Based on the most recent information that has been available to us, and after consultation with our Pittsburgh partners and with our staff at large, we are pleased to announce that we are proceeding with tentative preparations to host Anthrocon’s convention in Pittsburgh in July of 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Our online registration system for attendees will open on Monday, January 4, 2021.&nbsp; We are tentatively scheduling the opening of hotel reservations for Friday, April 9, 2021, at 12:00 Noon EST, with Super Sponsor hotel reservations being offered on Wednesday, April 7, at Noon EST.&nbsp; We appreciate that there may be lingering apprehension about social gatherings next summer; thus, we would like to provide some additional information that we hope will address those concerns.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Two vaccines for SARS-CoV2 are already approved and are being distributed in the United States, and there are at least 3 additional vaccines that are showing promise in Phase-3 clinical testing. Worldwide vaccination efforts are expected to be underway relatively soon.</p></li><li><p class="">Anthrocon leadership is in communication with all available resources in Pittsburgh and public health organizations to ensure that the convention can be hosted as safely as possible. The health and well-being of our staff, our attendees, and our associates in Pittsburgh are of paramount importance to us.</p></li><li><p class="">Anthrocon recognizes that as of this announcement, it is still ill-advised for people to gather in large numbers. Our ability to host the convention will be dependent on the status of the pandemic in July. We plan to abide fully by all municipal requests and/or health mandates in place in Pittsburgh at the time of the convention, but as Summer approaches, should we come to believe that the risks to our attendees’ health will be too great, we will postpone the event until 2022 and offer a virtual convention for 2021.</p></li><li><p class="">In order to maintain a safe environment for all, Anthrocon may be obliged to implement some changes to our policies or programming schedule, and we understand that some aspects of the convention may be different in 2021. One change that we anticipate to our Standards of Conduct is an agreement by attendees to wear protective masks. Please be reminded that the primary purpose of these masks is to protect others, not the wearer, and as it is possible that there will be some attendees present who remain at risk for infection, we may require anyone entering convention space to wear a mask that both covers their nose and mouth and does not have vents for exhalation. We would not ask fursuiters to wear extra respiratory protection as part of their suit, although we would strongly suggest that they wear a balaclava that covers their nose and mouth inside their fursuit head.</p></li><li><p class="">The theme and guest list from 2020 will carry over into 2021. It is important to note, however, that due to lingering travel restrictions or other circumstances beyond their control, one or more guests may not be able to attend. We will endeavor to announce any changes in our schedule of guests as soon as we ourselves are informed.</p></li><li><p class="">Payments for Anthrocon 2021 memberships will not be charged until April 2nd. When registering you will receive a confirmation email stating that you have been pre-registered for Anthrocon 2021. There will be a $1 pre-authorization charge that will be immediately reversed to verify that the card is valid. You will receive another confirmation email when payments are processed on April 2nd.</p></li></ul><p class="">We will be closely watching the progress of the vaccination program and the status of the pandemic within the US throughout the next few months to ensure that conditions remain favorable for hosting the convention.&nbsp; Our final decision as to whether or not we may proceed with the convention is expected in mid-May.&nbsp; We are hopeful that circumstances will be such that officials will give us the “green light” to proceed with minimal, if any, disruption to our traditional programming and convention offerings.&nbsp; We do ask for understanding from our attendees if we are required to make adjustments.</p><p class="">It is our hope that this announcement may bring a bit of hope and excitement to your holiday during these anxious and unprecedented times.&nbsp; We are eager to return to the beautiful city of Pittsburgh and to its gracious and inviting citizens, and more eager still to see the friends whom we have dearly missed this year.&nbsp; Most of all, we look forward to rekindling that very special feeling of camaraderie and fun that Anthrocon brings with each convention.</p><p class="">We wish all of our best to you and to those you love this holiday season, and hopefully, we will all see one another again in the summer of 2021!</p><p class=""><br>Sincerely</p><p class="">The Board of Directors of Anthrocon</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An update regarding 2021 registration</title><category>News</category><dc:creator>Nicona Shadowwolf</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2020 23:46:28 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.anthrocon.org/news/2020/10/2/an-update-regarding-2021-registration</link><guid isPermaLink="false">59d2e7962994ca6597e2795c:59d2f8971f318d87163c5ecb:5f77bafd614c320e212ae291</guid><description><![CDATA[As we look towards 2021, due to the continued uncertainty surrounding COVID

Right now, we believe the need for action is more important than just words. We stand with the Black community. We know that Black Lives Matter, and we want you to know that we hear you; we see you; we stand with you, and we support you. </p><p class="">Anthrocon believes that silence is not a vehicle for change. To that end, we know that we cannot improve as a convention, and as a community, without the valuable input of various members of the fandom, both staff and attendees who are People of Color. In doing that diligence, we have refrained from making a statement until we could provide a statement that was more than just words. Without their help, we cannot hope to continue working to improve Anthrocon’s diversity for the inclusiveness of all effectively. </p><p class="">Anthrocon is fully committed to proceeding with the following actions: </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">We will continue, and seek to increase, celebrating the contributions of People of Color as our Guests of Honor. </p></li><li><p class="">We will be reviewing our standards of conduct in-depth. We will be looking for ways to address concerns about current policies, which include, but will not be limited to, cosplay and fursuiting guidelines regarding military and law enforcement regalia and/or costumes. </p></li><li><p class="">We will reaffirm and commit to our zero-tolerance policy towards harassment or intimidation by attendees, staff, vendors, facilities, contracted security or law enforcement, or other individuals regardless of association with Anthrocon.  </p></li><li><p class="">We will hold open discussions for individuals to bring up concerns more directly with senior convention staff. </p></li><li><p class="">We are committed to diversity. We openly invite members of all ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, gender identities, and cultural backgrounds to apply to become Anthrocon staff. We wish to commit to greater diversity within our team and represent all persons within the furry fandom.  </p></li><li><p class="">We commit to having an open-door policy for reporting and dealing with issues of concern. We will implement an avenue for reporting ethics or other concerns directly to convention leadership. </p></li></ol><p class="">Some of these items will require time to implement. But we are committed to doing so, and in the coming months, we will make these changes a reality. </p><p class="">To the citizens of Pittsburgh, we say this: we support equality for all and celebrate your vibrant diversity. Let us stand together and move forward together to a brighter future. </p><p class="">To the attendees of Anthrocon: We are here. We are listening, we are standing with you, and we will strive to be better. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An important and sad announcement</title><category>News</category><dc:creator>Guest User</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 12:20:33 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.anthrocon.org/news/2020/6/22/an-important-and-sad-announcement</link><guid isPermaLink="false">59d2e7962994ca6597e2795c:59d2f8971f318d87163c5ecb:5ef0a0deca473c5982253117</guid><description><![CDATA[Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, for which there is no timely end in

The staff of Anthrocon place the health and safety of our attendees above all other factors, and have sought guidance from a variety of informed sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, Duke University Medical Center, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Allegheny County Health Department. VisitPittsburgh has been in frequent contact with the latter two agencies for updates. </p><p class="">At this time, there is no intention of canceling or delaying the Anthrocon 2020 convention. None of the agencies listed above has advised either course of action. We continue to monitor the situation daily, however, and should circumstances warrant either a cancellation or rescheduling, we will issue that announcement without delay on our web site and through all of our social media outlets. Please be patient. None of us can predict the course that this epidemic will take, and to what extent – or even if – it will be a concern in July. Our only choice is to rely on the advice of the medical professionals who are best situated to offer such advice. </p><p class="">At this time, no U.S. medical agency is advising travelers to cancel plans to travel to Western Pennsylvania, whereas of this date no cases of COVID-19 have been reported. We have had inquiries regarding the steps Anthrocon intends to take considering the very cosmopolitan makeup of our attendees. While we cannot make definitive plans so far in advance of the convention with the future course of the epidemic still unknown, there are a number of options that we may consider. Please note that these are possible courses of action and that no firm decision has been made on any. </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">We may restrict attendance of those who are coming from areas of the world where the virus has not been contained. </p></li><li><p class="">We may request that attendees who show symptoms of illness remain away from convention space and encourage those who are ill prior to departure to consider remaining home. </p></li><li><p class="">We may suggest that attendees refrain from hugging one another. While this is, of course, a cherished tradition within our community, it is unwise in an atmosphere where contagion may be lurking. </p></li><li><p class="">We fully intend to provide hand sanitizer to our attendees, either at numerous fixed stations or in portable bottles. At this time few, if any, suppliers are able to meet the demand; however, we have already placed a substantial order for hand sanitizer which we expect to receive in May of 2020. </p></li><li><p class="">All hotels provide an ample supply of soap. There is widespread agreement among the medical community that simply washing hands often for at least 20 seconds at a time is the most effective means of stopping the spread of coronaviruses such as COVID-19. </p></li><li><p class="">In the event that local, national, or international health authorities advise that the convention not take place, we may be forced to cancel or postpone the event. Should that be necessary, we will make a decision at that time as to the disposition of membership fees that have been paid to date. </p></li></ol><p class="">Once again, we do not intend to cancel or postpone Anthrocon’s 2020 convention; however, we must continue to monitor developments and to seek advice from the medical and emergency management communities. We will update our attendees as soon as possible should our plans have to change.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anthrocon to host citywide Children’s Art Show and Competition in 2020</title><category>News</category><dc:creator>Guest User</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 13:39:14 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.anthrocon.org/news/2020/2/11/anthrocon-to-host-citywide-childrens-art-show-and-competition-in-2020</link><guid isPermaLink="false">59d2e7962994ca6597e2795c:59d2f8971f318d87163c5ecb:5e42ad158185f139c70fdd1c</guid><description><![CDATA[PITTSBURGH – Anthrocon, Pittsburgh’s furry convention, will be offering

Division A will be for any student up to the age of 12.&nbsp; Division B will be for any and all students from age 13 to senior in high school.   Children must be active students and not have graduated from high school prior to May 1, 2020.&nbsp; Students enrolled in any online schools or who are being homeschooled are eligible, but must be able to provide verification of their student status.  This year, students at the collegiate level will not be eligible.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Requirements of artwork to be submitted</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">All artwork submitted to the Anthrocon Children’s Art Competition must feature “anthropomorphic” or animal characters.&nbsp; The style of the characters is open to interpretation.  This means they can be of a cartoon form, realistic in design, or of a level anywhere in between.&nbsp; Also, the characters can be of a true animal form, a mythical animal form, or a completely original animal creation or hybrid between animals.</p></li><li><p class="">The artwork should be related to or incorporate the convention’s theme.&nbsp; This year, the convention theme is “Aesop’s Fables”.  This can be a classic and literal interpretation or it can be a modern interpretation.</p></li><li><p class="">The artwork must be done solely by the student, without outside help in the execution of the artwork.&nbsp; We realize that very young students may need some help with reading fables or understanding the stories and meanings.&nbsp; This is acceptable. However, all drawings, sketches, or other activities involved with the creation of the artwork must be done by the child alone.&nbsp; The goal is to allow each child’s artistic strength and vision to be seen.  Even a very young child can create something that may move the judges, so please allow the student to do their own work.</p></li><li><p class="">Almost any artistic medium may be used, so long as it is fairly rugged and can be displayed without means of an electronic display. Examples would include but are not limited to: pencil, ink, pastel, watercolor, paint, crayon, finger painting, hardened polymer clay, fired natural clay, paper-mâché, fabric, artificial fur, acrylic or other plastic, needlepoint, and other creative materials. Because of the risk of damage, please do not use soft/raw clay, glass, slate, or other fragile materials. Digital drawings or paintings created on a computer or tablet may also be entered, although they would later need to be printed if chosen for public display.</p></li><li><p class="">All submissions must be of appropriate content for “all ages” viewing.&nbsp; Any artwork showing excessive violence, or images of a graphic nature will be disqualified.</p></li></ol></li><li><p class=""><strong>All artwork should be submitted with the following information</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The student’s name</p></li><li><p class="">The student’s age</p></li><li><p class="">The student’s grade and art teacher (if available)</p></li><li><p class="">The student’s school</p></li><li><p class="">The title of the art piece (if applicable)</p></li><li><p class="">Contact information (parent, teacher, or school administrator)This information should be written on a label affixed to the back of flat artwork, or on a card tied securely to 3-D artwork.</p></li></ol></li><li><p class=""><strong>The deadline for submissions will be June 1, 2020</strong>. &nbsp; A digital scan or image of the artwork must be received by Anthrocon by 11:59 pm on June 1, 2020, at the following e-mail address:&nbsp; Childrens_Art_Show@anthrocon.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Judging</strong>: &nbsp; Art may be judged based on many factors including, but not limited to:&nbsp; concept, character design, overall execution, color usage, originality and imagination, complexity, implementation of the annual theme.&nbsp; Members of the Anthrocon Board of Directors will make the final decisions on the top pieces of artwork.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Artwork display</strong>:&nbsp; Anthrocon hopes to be able to display as much of the submitted artwork as possible.&nbsp; If the number of submitted pieces exceeds the space available for the Art Display, then a variety of pieces, including the top selections will be displayed.&nbsp; The location of this display will be determined and announced as the convention approaches.  The physical artwork for public display will need to be delivered to the Art Show representatives at the David Lawrence Convention Center on Thursday, July 2 or Friday, July 3, 2020.&nbsp; To safeguard against damage in handling and display, the artwork should be protected in some way.  Flat artwork (drawings, paintings, digital prints, etc.) should be mounted on an art matte or placed in a print protector sleeve, with a backing board.  3-D artwork (sculpture, jewelry, papier-mache, etc.) should be packed in a sturdy cardboard box with cushioning materials, and identifying labels (see 3, above) attached to both the artwork and the box.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Winners</strong>:&nbsp; Winners will be announced at the convention.&nbsp; Anthrocon will provide more details about the announcement of the winners closer to the convention date.</p></li><li><p class="">The submitted physical artwork will become the property of Anthrocon, but the copyright of the artwork will be retained by the student, with Anthrocon and VisitPITTSBURGH granted permission in perpetuity to publish (either in print or electronic form) any artwork images for promotional or similar use without compensation. Anthrocon and visitPittsburgh will make every effort to return the physical artwork after the convention if so requested, but this may not be possible.</p></li></ol><p class="">Anthrocon is very excited to support the children’s art community in the city of Pittsburgh.&nbsp; It is our hope that this is yet another bond forming between our convention and the amazing city that has become our host.&nbsp; We look forward to seeing the amazing creations of the children of Pittsburgh, and eagerly await returning in July 2020!</p><p class=""><strong><em>PITTSBURGH, MIGHTY, BEAUTIFUL!</em></strong></p><p class=""><strong><em>PITTSBURGH, MIGHTY, ARTISTIC!</em></strong></p><p class=""><strong><em>PITTSBURGH, MIGHTY, FURRY!</em></strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
