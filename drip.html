<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are to be no sales in the Dealers Room except by appropriate and authorized Dealerships in appropriate and authorized areas. Sharing space at your table(s) with unapproved dealerships is not allowed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dealers have to register with Pennsylvania for a tax license; it's free. Each dealership requires one tax license. You must have a tax license before applying for a Dealership.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dealers have to purchase a Dealer Membership and a Table for their Dealership. Dealer Assistant Memberships may be bought alongside, or be purchased separately. Your Dealer Assistant must be associated with your Dealership.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>ELECTRICITY IS NOT INCLUDED FOR DEALERSHIPS, EXCEPT BOOTHS</strong>. Electrical power may be purchased through the DLCC through an online form, which will be provided to approved dealers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tables can be regular, endcap, or booth. Sizes start as small as a Half Table and go large as a Large Booth. We'll try to put you where you'd like and with people you like.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dealership applications will be queued into a Curated system; the application will be Reviewed by the Dealers Room staff, Approved or Declined, then Placed. Payment will not be processed until the dealer has been approved and placed. Applications will be open for approximately one month.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Any Dealerships not accepted at first will be placed on the waitlist. If a Dealership space opens, waitlisted Dealers will be contacted. There are sometimes at-con sales of last-minute canceled tables.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>If you have to cancel your table</strong>, notify the Dealers Room staff by April 30 to secure a full refund. If you have to cancel your membership, do so by June 10th or there's no refund. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dealers have setup time Thursday and early Friday to load things in. Pick up your badge first from Dealer Registration; Assistants need to pick up their own badges. If you are unloading items from your vehicle, the Teamsters must carry them in from the loading dock and will do so for free.&nbsp;<a href="dlcc-shipping-guide.html"><strong>Learn about shipping items to the DLCC</strong></a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You cannot sell things that are against applicable rules or laws. Adult material must be covered up from minors. Displays must not encroach on other dealerships, and lights, music or sound, and strong smells or fumes must be kept under your control.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Moveout begins at 4PM on Sunday, and you have to clean up your area and check out with the staff. If the Teamsters moved stuff in, they usually have to move it out.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dealers Room Staff have say on all matters. The Dealers Room Director's decisions are final.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You are expected to have read and abide by the complete rules of the DRIP, as well as the Standards of Conduct and any other Anthrocon policies.

<h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Step I: Obtaining a Pennsylvania Tax license</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>You must have a Pennsylvania sales tax license to sell any taxable items at Anthrocon! No exceptions!</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All dealers are required to collect and report a state tax of 6% and a city tax of 1% on all sales (excluding T-shirts and other "primary" clothing, which are not taxable). That means a total sales tax of 7%. If there is a question as to whether an item is going to be taxable, please contact the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue or visit their website at <a href="http://www.revenue.state.pa.us/"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>http://www.revenue.state.pa.us</strong></span></a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your payment for a Dealership at Anthrocon includes all applicable taxes and fees <strong>unless you have paid employees on site</strong>. Memberships, including Dealer and Dealer Assistant Memberships, are not taxed. No discounts are given for any dealership for whom a particular tax or fee does not apply; for example, if a dealer desires only one table instead of two in a Double Table space, the payment will not be discounted for the cost of the table.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Getting (or reactivating) Pennsylvania Tax Licenses</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pennsylvania's tax system is a bit cumbersome for itinerant dealers. Each dealer must keep his or her license active by filing twice a year, and the authorities are known to randomly change that to quarterly for reasons unknown. For the first half of the year, you need only file a return that says "0" in all the fields. For the second half of the year (when Anthrocon is held), you would file normally, and the Department of Revenue has<a href="https://www.etides.state.pa.us/default.asp"><span style="text-decoration:underline"> <strong>a handy web page</strong></span></a> that lets you do that. That is sufficient to keep your tax license active.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you fail to file, you will need to reactivate your account before you can make sales in Pennsylvania. You can do this by filling out a <em>physical</em> copy of the state's PA-100 form, which you can download <a href="http://www.revenue.state.pa.us/revenue/lib/revenue/pa-100.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>here</strong></span></a>. Fill out only sections 1-4 and section 18, with the information provided for the PA-100 below.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A sales tax license can be obtained by using the online version of the <a href="http://www.pa100.state.pa.us/"><span style="text-decoration:underline">PA-100 form</span></a>. You must use this form to apply for a new sales tax license if you never had one. You cannot use the online version to reactivate a prior license.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">International attendees will need a sales tax license, and at last report, you can still get one even if you have no US Social Security Number. Please contact us at <strong><a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="197d7c78757c6b6a5978776d716b767a767737766b7e">[email&#160;protected]</a></strong> for instructions.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you already have an active license, you do not need to fill out the PA-100 form; just report to us your license number. If you previously had a Pennsylvania State sales tax license that has become inactive, or if you have never had a license in Pennsylvania, you will need to fill out the PA-100 form. Use the following information where it is requested. Remember, each section has its own help feature if you get stuck. <strong>Please do not contact Anthrocon for help with this form!</strong> If the help screen and the information provided below are not enough, contact the Department of Revenue directly with your question.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Section 1:</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Select "New registration," and answer the questions.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Section 2:</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">If you don't already have a Pennsylvania sales tax license, the date of first operations will be 06/30/2023.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">If you don't know when your fiscal year ends, make it 12/31</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Section 3:</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Check the box that says TRANSIENT VENDOR CERTIFICATE if you are not a Pennsylvania resident or SALES, USE AND HOTEL TAX if you are a Pennsylvania resident.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">The box that comes up when you check "Transient Vendor Certificate" is just a reminder.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Section 5&amp;6:</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">If you're by yourself, you're a sole proprietor and your ownership is 100%.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">If you have a partner or are a corporation, note that in the appropriate space.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">You are only responsible for SALES TAX unless you have employees who are joining you. <strong>If you are a company that will have paid employees on-site, please contact us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="dcb8b9bdb0b9aeaf9cbdb2a8b4aeb3bfb3b2f2b3aebb">[email&#160;protected]</a> for further instructions.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Section 7:</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">If you sell manufactured goods, they are either WHOLESALE or RETAIL.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Otherwise, most of our dealers will fall under ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT &amp; RECREATION, and will follow that selection with PERFORMING ARTS, then INDEPENDENT ARTISTS, WRITERS, and PERFORMERS.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Section 8:</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Select ALLEGHENY County in the list of boxes</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Section 18:</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">The date of the first sale is 6/30/2023, and the number of shows is 1 (Anthrocon).

That means that you <em>must</em> have a valid tax license before you can submit an application for a dealer table.&nbsp; You <em>must </em>submit it with your application, or it will not be considered.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You must report your sales tax license number to us each year.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>One Dealer, One Dealership, One Sales Tax License</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Anthrocon wishes to remind our dealers that we have a policy of strict adherence to state and local tax codes. It is illegal for multiple dealerships to share a single tax license. Thus, our general rules regarding tables and tax licenses are as follows:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A contiguous table space (including multiple tables purchased together by one individual) represents "one Dealership." It is staffed by one dealer, and optionally one or more dealer assistants who are there to help the dealer in making sales. A single tax license is required for each Dealership.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;A "Dealer Assistant" (DA) is a friend, spouse, relative, or other party who will spend time helping you with load-in, load-out, setting up, and/or sales. If the primary interest of the second person at the table is to sell their own merchandise, even though they may be helping you to sell yours, that person does not constitute a "Dealer Assistant."</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Under no circumstances may two different dealerships at different tables share one tax license. If you wish to share a table with another dealer, you must purchase two table spaces, one for each of you. Do not purchase a table with the intent to share it with someone else.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We understand that some dealers wish to share a table with others and are worried that they will be unable to if they submit separate applications. Anthrocon will make every reasonable effort to keep friends together, though you must let us know on your applications that you both desire to sit near or next to one another. Please make sure that both you and your friend are requesting compatible table types.<br><br>Anthrocon understands some Dealerships are studios or partnerships. Any Dealerships that are in a studio system must make clear on their application that the works are coming from a studio system that operates as a united business, with one tax license and one cashbox. There must be one lead Dealer.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No table space may be shared with, exchanged, sublet, or resold to another Dealer without the prior consent of Anthrocon's Dealers Room Director. This will require a completed dealer room application and advance arrangement with the Dealers Room Director. Any unauthorized sharing may result in revocation of dealer space, or removal from consideration for space in future years.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In order to legally enter into contracted table space, dealers must be at least 18 years of age as of the beginning date of the convention (June 29th, 2023 for Anthrocon 2023). Dealer Assistants must be at least 13 years of age, the minimum age to be a badge holding Member of the convention.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Merchandise can only be sold in approved, authorized areas of Hall A&amp;B and by approved, authorized Dealerships. Hotel policies and local tax regulations prevent sales from hotel guest rooms, common areas of hotels, unapproved convention space, or on the street. These regulations apply during the complete duration of Anthrocon, not merely during Dealer's Room hours.</p></li></ul><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Step II: Application</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Applications are planned to open in October 2022. They will be open for at least four weeks.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For 2023, go to the following URL: <a href="https://anthrocon.regfox.com/anthroconreg" target="_blank"><strong>https://anthrocon.regfox.com/anthroconreg</strong></a>. You will be asked for a passcode, this will be posted on <a href="dealers.html"><strong>our Dealers page</strong></a>. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE PASSCODE YOU CANNOT PURCHASE A DEALER TABLE</strong>, nor register as a Dealer or Dealer Assistant. The code may be case-sensitive.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fill out your application completely and carefully. You can also apply for Dealer Assistant (DA) Memberships directly there, purchase them later, or have your DAs purchase their own badges. DAs may use the access code to mark themselves as DAs, or you may email us to change a purchased standard Membership to a DA Membership.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Dealers Room Staff will review your submission and begin approvals as promptly as possible, hopefully, to begin in December 2022. We may ask you for more information before we can approve your Dealership. You'll be emailed about approval, denial, or waitlisting.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you do not provide your Pennsylvania Revenue ID (Tax ID) number with your application, we will not consider your application for curation until we have that information, and you will be considered after those who have provided a Pennsylvania Revenue ID. Anthrocon does not take responsibility for informing you that you did not provide a Pennsylvania Revenue ID. Again, <em>only applications with a Tax ID can get approved for a table.</em><br><br><strong>Types of Memberships: Dealers and Dealer Assistants</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Dealers</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Dealer is the lead person for the Dealership. In almost all cases, they will be the person who holds the Pennsylvania Tax License; they will be directly responsible for the Dealership; and they will be the authority for questions from Dealers Room Staff, convention staff, or Convention Center staff. Every Dealership must have one and only one Dealer, and a Dealer can belong to only one Dealership.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can apply for a Dealer, Dealer+Sponsor, or Dealer+Supersponsor Membership. Higher levels of Sponsorship are always appreciated! You may also feel free to upgrade your Membership at any time before the close of Pre-registration, by returning to the link for Membership sent by email to you. Dealer Memberships of all types may be converted to the equivalent standard Membership if needed: see the 'Cancelling Your Dealership' for further information.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Dealer Assistants</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A Dealer Assistant (DA) is an assistant to a Dealer, serving as part of their Dealership, with most of the same access and sales privileges as a Dealer. DA status is particularly important during setup and breakdown, as only Dealers and DAs are permitted in the Dealer's Room during those hours. Dealerships may have multiple DAs, based on the size of their Table and their needs. Each DA must be assigned to one and only one Dealership, though DAs are permitted to aid other Dealerships. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">DA memberships may also be Sponsor or Supersponsor in level. DA Memberships may be purchased by their Dealer or may be purchased separately, no Dealer Assistant Memberships are included in Table costs. If DAs are purchased separately, Anthrocon MUST receive emailed communication from the Dealer by the close of Pre-registration (June 10th, 2023) that an individual is to be made a DA. Making someone a Dealer Assistant on-site is possible, but it will slow down everyone.&nbsp; <em>Please handle DAs in advance, </em>it will save a great deal of waiting in line on site. <strong><em>PLEASE.</em></strong></p>

<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Types and Sizes of Dealership Tables</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Standard tables. These are located in rows, typically in groups of five. Other dealers will be beside you, and in a row directly behind you.<br><strong>Electrical power is NOT included</strong>; it must be purchased from the convention center. Information will be made available on the website, as well as by email to approved dealers, when the order forms for 2023 are finalized.<br></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Endcap tables.&nbsp; These are identical to Standard tables, except these are located on the end of a row. The amount of them is limited, and they may only be purchased as Single or Triple tables. Endcap dealers must be mindful of table gaps for evacuation purposes, and may not expand their Dealership to close them.<br><strong>Electrical power is NOT included</strong>; it must be purchased from the convention center. Information will be made available on the website, as well as by email to approved dealers, when the order forms for 2023 are finalized.<br></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Booths. These are open spaces bounded on two or three sides by pipe and drape. All the space within may be used, and tables and chairs are provided. Each comes with a two-outlet circuit into which up to 1000 Watts of equipment may be plugged.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Table sizes are as follows, and one seat will be provided for every 4 feet of table:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Half. 4 feet wide by 8-10 feet deep. This includes half of an 8 foot by 2.5-foot table, and another dealer will be at the other half.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Single: 8 feet wide by 8-10 feet deep.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Single+Half: 12 feet wide by 8-10 feet deep. This is a Single table and adjoining half of a table, and another dealer will be at the other half.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Double: 16 feet by 8-10 feet deep.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Triple: 24 feet by 8-10 feet deep.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Quad: 32 feet by 8-10 feet deep.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Quint: 40 feet by 8-10 feet deep.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Small Booths: 16 feet wide by 16 feet deep, bounded on two or three sides by pipe and drape. 4 tables and 8 chairs to be provided.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Large Booths: 20 feet wide by 24 feet deep, bounded on two or three sides by pipe and drape. 6 tables and 12 chairs to be provided.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All non-booth tables include 6-7.5 feet of space behind the table, but sufficient walking paths must be kept open to enable other Dealers to move in and out. Between some tables, there will be safety gaps for exit and emergency evacuation; merchandise must not encroach into these gaps. This includes gaps adjoining endcap tables. Gaps may not be relocated without the approval of staff.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Upon request, tables and chairs may be removed from your area; <strong>please </strong>contact us in advance of the convention with these requests.<br><br>With Half Tables and Single+Half Tables, relocating or removing of a shared table requires the full agreement of both Dealerships using the table.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Extra tables added to your space will require the purchase of at least a Double Table, payment of a surcharge, and advance communication with the Dealers Room Staff. We cannot place additional chairs at your dealership due to space and supply constraints.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Step III: Approval&nbsp;</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dealerships at Anthrocon will be approved on a curated basis.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Curation will be performed principally by the Anthrocon Dealers Room staff, although other Anthrocon staff may be involved. Dealerships will be chosen based on a variety of factors, including:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On-Topic: How much of a dealer's wares relate to furry fandom or other interests of typical Anthrocon Members?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Quality: Is a Dealership selling quality goods that will interest our Members and make for good sales? This may be judged by information and photographs from&nbsp; a Dealer’s website, prior years in the Dealers Room, and/or additional information.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Variety: Are there many or few Dealerships selling products of this type? Are they filling a niche other Dealers will not be?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prior Status: Has the Dealer been a Guest of Honor or Charitable Organization with Anthrocon before?</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Applications for one table type that is full, such as Endcaps or Booths, may be offered an alternate table type.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Incomplete applications will not be considered until they are completed. The usual reason for an incomplete application is the lack of a Pennsylvania Revenue ID; please arrange these in advance! The responsibility for an incomplete application rests on a Dealer and not on Anthrocon Staff.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Step IV: Payment</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For 2023 we will request as part of your application if you need advance notice before charging your Dealership and Membership fees. This will make no difference on your application either way. <br>If you request notice, we will email you to ask for confirmation. Once we have your confirmation, Anthrocon will charge your debit or credit card within 48 hours of the mutually approved time. We plan to begin approval and payment request in late December.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Anthrocon cannot move on to Placement without payment. If multiple charging attempts fail, if you cannot give approval in a reasonable timeframe, or if you do not respond to contact attempts, Anthrocon may cancel your application and open it to the next person on the Waitlist.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Anthrocon handles all transactions in US Dollars, via credit or debit cards. Anthrocon does not accept PayPal.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Step V: Placement!</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once payment is complete, Anthrocon will review your application and find the best place to seat you, based on your requests and our table availability. We will email you with your table placement. We must note that table placements are not final until the convention, and especially within the first month of placements, there may be switches of location. If you would prefer a different location after placement, please request one promptly and we'll make an effort to re-seat you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the extremely rare event there is a conflict of placement at the convention, Dealers Room Staff will determine any placement adjustments.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Waiting Lists and Cancellations</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once tables are filled in the Dealers Room, all remaining applications will be placed on the Waitlist.<strong> We will inform you if you have been placed on the waitlist; this may take some time for us to process, especially during the first round of curation of the room.  </strong>It is entirely possible that some Dealers may be told of their approval before other dealers are told of their Waitlist status. We do not knowingly oversell the Dealers Room.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Traditionally, we see a certain amount of attrition from dealers who discover scheduling conflicts or encounter other obstacles to attending Anthrocon. We will process the Waitlist based on the same curated criteria.&nbsp; Let us know you are willing to accept a different table type than your requested one; <em>this will increase your chances of obtaining a table</em>!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once a table comes open, we will email the next Dealer on the waitlist that has a matching acceptable table type that their application is available for approval. There will be a limited time for response, usually a week. Once the Dealer indicates their willingness to purchase a table, the appropriate table type will be approved and the payment promptly processed. All payments must be made by Credit or Debit Card. If we need an updated version of your credit card information, a phone call should be arranged; do not email us credit card information!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the event you are unable to get a table from the waitlist, any Dealer or Dealer Assistant Membership can become an Attending Membership at the listed price. Similarly, Dealer+Sponsors can be Sponsors and Dealer+Supersponsors can be Supersponsors. However, we will not convert memberships unless emailed before the close of Pre-registration (June 10th, 2023). These Memberships may also be canceled until the close of Pre-registration; please email refunds(at)anthrocon.org if a Membership refund is needed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you find that you will not be able to make use of one or more of your dealer tables, please inform us as soon as possible. <em>It is unfair to dealers who are on the waiting list to keep them waiting</em> until it is too late for them to make reasonable travel arrangements. It is also unfair and against Anthrocon's policy to transfer an unwanted table to another person to bypass the waiting list.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Cancellation of tables or Memberships should be directed to <strong><a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2b4f4e4a474e59586b4a455f4359444844450544594c">[email&#160;protected]</a></strong> as well as <strong><a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2d5f484b5843495e6d4c4359455f424e424303425f4a">[email&#160;protected]</a></strong>. If canceling a table, please mention explicitly if you wish to cancel your Dealer membership or have it revert to a standard membership.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Full refunds will be given for tables that are canceled on or before April 30th, 2022. <strong>No refunds will be given for tables canceled after this!</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Full refunds will be given for 2023 memberships that are canceled on or before June 10th, 2023. <strong>No refunds will be given for memberships canceled after this!</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are occasionally last-minute cancellations that cannot be replaced before the close of pre-registration. Anthrocon will offer these tables first-come first-serve to appropriate potential Dealers with a Pennsylvania Tax ID; or as upgrade options for Dealers seeking a larger table. Please see us at Dealer Registration if you're interested!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Any table that is left unclaimed as of 10:00 am on Saturday, July 1st may be offered first-come first-serve to appropriate potential Dealers unless the owner of the table contacts us prior to that time and explains the situation to our satisfaction. If you know you will be late or are unable to attend at the last minute, please get in contact with us by Email, Twitter, or other means. <strong>&nbsp;Note that if you fail to claim a table and do not inform us in advance of the convention, it may affect your future opportunities to have a dealer table at Anthrocon!</strong></p>

<h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Registration and Membership Badges</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">DEALER REGISTRATION WILL BE IN HALL D FOR 2023! Be aware that you cannot proceed to the second floor and Concourse A to enter the Dealers Room without first checking in and receiving your badge in Hall D on the first floor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thursday beginning at noon, the Dealers Room Staff will begin processing Membership badges. This tends to be a quite prompt process in most cases. Each Dealer and Dealer Assistant must present their own photo ID and must pick up their own Membership Badge. If it is necessary to change someone's badge type to Dealer Assistant at the door, it will be handled as such:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pre-registered Members must pick up their badges first, and then present them to Dealer Registration for reprinting as Dealer Assistant.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On-Site Members must register for the convention, either in the On-Site line (Cash or credit/debit) or using an electronic device for Online registration and payment (Credit/debit only). Their Dealer must be present to certify the DA's status before the printing of badges, or Dealers Registration can provide a certified pass to verify this information. DAs who need to use On-Site registration may use the expedited line, usually listed as the 'Sponsor Line'. DAs using online registration may handle this at Dealer Registration.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Load-In and Union Labor Issues</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Any convention facility large enough to house Anthrocon has a unionized workforce. We are quite fortunate that the unions who are employed by the David L. Lawrence Convention Center are reasonable and have been willing to work with us on many issues. It is important that our Dealers understand the rules that will pertain to the Dealers Room:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">During all setup and teardown periods, dealers may hand-carry or use a non-motorized cart to carry in their wares and materials from the concourse. Anything that is large enough to require a forklift, a motorized cart, or a cart that does not fit in the DLCC’s passenger elevators will need professional moving. Please contact Anthrocon in advance for rates for these specialized services.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Anthrocon will employ Union labor to assist dealers with moving materials to and from the loading dock during setup and teardown (again, at no additional cost to those dealers). The Union team and loading dock will be available (tentatively) from 3:00 PM until 9:00 PM on Thursday, June 29th, and from 8:00 AM until 11:45 PM on Friday, June 30th to bring items in.&nbsp; Union Labor and the loading dock will be available from 4 PM until 8 PM on Sunday, July 2nd for teardown.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The air conditioning in Halls A and B automatically shuts off when the loading dock doors are open. During load-in, the room will be warm; please dress accordingly and stay hydrated during these times. Once the doors close, the air conditioning will come back on and the room will cool down.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All dealerships under 400 sqft may now use battery-powered tools, install floor coverings, and generally avoid carpentry calls. Large Booths are currently limited to hand-powered tools installed by a single person or will require a union carpenter at additional rates.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is important that Anthrocon maintain a strong and friendly working relationship with the local staff. If you have any disagreements or issues with any Union or Non-Union Convention Center employee, please do not argue with them. Bring your disagreement to one of the Dealers Room Staff.</p></li></ul>

<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>﻿</strong><br>At the scheduled times, the Dealers Room will open to Members. Each day, there is an initial period where Sponsors and Supersponsors are permitted entry before General Admission. Please be aware that these people are generally in a hurry to visit one or two Dealers of their choice, so be ready for them!</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Guidelines on merchandise</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Items offered for sale in the Anthrocon Dealers Room should be related to the anthropomorphic theme of the convention or should have a broad appeal to furries and others in attendance at Anthrocon.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Any item that is prohibited for direct sale is also not permitted for display, giveaway, or delivery during or after the convention unless otherwise specified.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Items and services that are illegal to possess or sell in the United States, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or City of Pittsburgh (Firearms or restricted weapons, pornography involving minors, etc.) are prohibited in the Dealers' Room. Items and services that require a specific permit or license to display or sell shall require the Dealer to present the license.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The responsibility to ensure proper copyright of merchandise rests with Dealerships. Anthrocon recommends Dealers research and be aware of the legality of copyrights, trademarks, works of parody, and fan art.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Depiction of real or fictional minors in adult situations is prohibited.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Non-firearm weaponry such as swords are acceptable provided these weapons do not have a sharp edge and that the purchases are fully wrapped afterward. As per Anthrocon safety policy, these items may not be waved or otherwise brandished in public. Any items which resemble firearms but are non-firing must also be fully wrapped and not brandished. Customers who purchase such items should be encouraged to carry them directly to their hotel rooms or vehicles.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Items of a distinctly adult or sexual nature whose primary purpose is functional rather than artistic are prohibited. As Anthrocon encourages public health and safety for its attendees, an exception is made for sale or giveaway of condoms and similar prophylactics.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By contract with the David L Lawrence Convention Center, food and drink sales, displays, and giveaways are not permitted in the Dealers Room without express approval from the Director and Levy Catering. Contact us for details.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No items may be produced or sold that bear the name "Anthrocon" or the Anthrocon logo. "Anthrocon" and the Anthrocon logo are registered servicemarks of Anthrocon, Inc. Trademark law requires that we prohibit either of these from being used without being formally licensed by Anthrocon, Inc. Such a license agreement requires Anthrocon to request a licensing fee, and also that we pre-approve the use of our servicemarks before items bearing them are produced.</p></li></ul><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Guidelines on display</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;<em>The decision regarding what is and what is not appropriate material for display will rest entirely with the Dealers Room Director. Dealers Room Staff at the convention are considered to be acting in accord with the Director, especially as regards appropriate material. You may disagree with our decisions, but you must abide by them.</em></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Artwork, clothing, or other items of an appropriate but adult nature may be sold only if they are kept from public view. Such items must be covered or similarly shielded.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Artwork containing adult material may either be shielded by Post-It notes, stickers, or a similar covering, or ideally should be kept in a clearly-marked binder which must be kept closed by the dealer when it is not being viewed by an adult customer. Binders or portfolios containing uncensored artwork must be separate from other binders. A tag or divider between "regular" and "adult" material is not sufficient. Any censoring of artwork (pixelation, blurring, censorship bars) must be done to the satisfaction of Dealers Room Staff.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Artwork, clothing, and other items of an appropriate but adult nature must be delivered to the customer in opaque packaging that obscures the mature item completely, such as a bag, envelope, or folder. If a customer has their own packaging, they may place it inside that instead.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Minors will be clearly identified by a brightly colored name-field on their membership badges; likewise, the entire reverse of the badge will be the same bright color. Further information on how to recognize them will be available on site. <strong>Anthrocon holds each dealer responsible to ensure that minors are not permitted to view, handle, or be otherwise exposed to adult materials</strong>. If you are in doubt, you can ask your client for identification before allowing him or her to view your wares. Dealers who are found to be displaying adult-oriented items in such a fashion that they can be viewed by underaged members will be afforded a single warning; further incidents may result in that dealer being removed from the Dealers Room without refund and possible loss of Dealers Room privileges for future conventions. Please note that in the case of disagreement, the opinion of the Dealers Room Director as to the suitability (or lack thereof) of wares for general display will be final.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>DEALERS MUST BE AWARE THAT MEMBERS OF THE PRESS, CITY OFFICIALS, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAY BE PRESENT IN THE DEALERS' ROOM DURING REGULAR HOURS.</strong> All signs, banners, standing displays, etc. must, therefore, must abide by a strict "PG" or better rating. Any display that may be damaging to Anthrocon's public image is strictly forbidden.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Five Senses Rule: Your table's displays, merchandise, and staff should not annoy customers or other dealers with sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch. Specific concerns are bright flashing lights, loudspeakers, and strong scents. Video soundtracks, CD previews, video games, and other audio need to be kept at such a volume that they do not annoy customers or other dealers; headphones are recommended if audio is a primary selling point of your business. The Dealers Room Director and Staff have the final authority on what does and what does not constitute an annoyance.</p></li></ul><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Guidelines on sales</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sales are to be made only by Dealerships; that includes Dealers, Dealer Assistants, or another Member of Anthrocon directly designated by a Dealer to make sales. Anthrocon recommends any person a Dealer plans to have watch their table or make sales for an extended period of time be made a Dealer Assistant.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sales must be made in appropriate and authorized areas; this is generally understood to be the area of your Dealer Table within Halls A&amp;B. Sales in the walking aisles, front and rear, and other public areas of Hall A&amp;B or other convention space are not permitted except with the express permission of the Dealers Room Director.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Anthrocon Performers may, with special arrangement with the Dealers Room Director and Programming Director, sell merchandise near to their performance. The Performer must be a part of a Dealership and have a Dealer or Dealer Assistant Membership. The merchandise for remote sale must typically also be for sale at the Dealership. This must be pre-arranged with the Dealers Room Director and Programming Director. Contact us for details.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sales, exchanges, and barter between Dealerships are quite welcomed. Taxes must still be calculated appropriately.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While all Dealers must pay appropriate Pennsylvania sales tax, it is their choice if that sales tax cost is passed to the Member purchasing goods, or included in listed prices.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dealerships may accept payment in such a manner as they choose, so long as sales for sales tax is calculated in US dollars. We recommend if your dealership will accept cash that you bring plenty of change and small bills; Anthrocon cannot make change for you.</p></li></ul><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Guidelines on actions.</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is to be no horseplay in the Dealers Room. This includes the use of any squirt guns, silly string, or any flown or thrown item. Anthrocon is not responsible for injuries, breakage, or loss incurred by or caused by any dealer or attendee.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Items or services that may make a mess, such as face painting, should have a disposable floor covering in order to contain the mess and make for easy cleanup. Similarly, items or services with pathogen concerns, such as tattooing, will require Dealers and Members to have appropriate Personal Protective Equipment.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is a strict NO SMOKING policy in the Dealers Room. This also means no vaping. Furthermore, no items that generate an open flame or excessive heat may be employed. If you have an air compressor or similar motorized equipment, you must obtain clearance from the David L. Lawrence Convention Center (through the Dealers Room Director) prior to its use.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Electrical power is exclusively for use of the Dealerships and is meant only for business equipment and their important personal devices.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dealers may feel free to spend as much or as little time at their Dealer Table during Dealer hours as they choose. However, if a Dealer table is seeing minimal use and minimal display during the convention, we will make a note for future years and seek more active Dealers for the benefit of our membership.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Complaints or concerns about the Dealers Room should be directed onsite to the Dealers Room Staff or Director. You may also feel free to contact Safety, Convention Operations, or other staff persons during the convention for appropriate issues, particularly for urgent situations. Please try to notify us of your concerns on site if possible- we want to help you out promptly!</p>

<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>﻿</strong><br>Cleanup, Check-out, and Load-out</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All Dealerships will be given a check-out form during the convention, typically on Sunday morning. This form must be filled out and given to the Dealers Room staff or a designated Volunteer, who will check their area to ensure it has been packed up and is clean. This checkout procedure may begin early for small dealers who wish to leave in a hurry, but the loading dock and union labor are not available until 4 pm. Only Dealerships with a filled-out checkout form are considered ready for departure.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Anthrocon is responsible for leaving the Convention Hall in a "broom clean" condition. We are assessed a steep fee if unreasonable amounts of garbage, empty boxes, etc. are left behind when the room is vacated. Trash receptacles will be provided, especially for teardown on Sunday. <strong>Any Dealership that leaves an excessive amount of waste behind in their area will be responsible for a $100 cleaning fee, payable to Anthrocon.</strong></p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After the Dealers Room closes at 4:00 pm on Sunday, load-out begins in force. Dealerships are expected to rapidly pack and clean their areas to ensure a swift departure. From 4pm onward, only Dealers and DAs are permitted presence and entry to the Dealers Room. This is a very busy time, especially for those who will need Loading Dock access for their vehicles. Usually, all but our largest Dealerships are clear by 7:00 pm.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Large Dealerships with large vehicles are often permitted to drive their vehicle onto the floor to speed load-out. This is a limited service and is completely at the discretion of Anthrocon Staff and DLCC employees.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Taxis or similar vehicles must wait in line as any other vehicles if using the loading dock. They are not recommended.</p></li></ul>
