<div class="amp-article-html-block"><p class=""><strong>PITTSBURGH</strong> – Anthrocon, Pittsburgh’s furry convention, will be offering something new for its 2020 convention.&nbsp; Anthrocon has developed a wonderful, synergistic relationship with the city of Pittsburgh, and wishes to give back a bit more, this time to the children of the city.&nbsp; Therefore, Anthrocon is pleased to announce a new children’s art competition with 2 divisions and special prizes for the top pieces of art in each division. The division for its younger entrants will have a top prize of a $100 Amazon gift card.&nbsp; The division for its entrants up to seniors in high school will have a top prize available of a $1,000 grant, which can be used at the entrant’s discretion for tuition or educational supplies.</p>
<p class="">The rules for the competition are as follows:</p>
<ol data-rte-list="default">
 <li><p class=""><strong>Eligibility</strong>:&nbsp; The entrant must be a student in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.&nbsp; There will be 2 different divisions based on age. Division A will be for any student up to the age of 12.&nbsp; Division B will be for any and all students from age 13 to senior in high school. Children must be active students and not have graduated from high school prior to May 1, 2020.&nbsp; Students enrolled in any online schools or who are being homeschooled are eligible, but must be able to provide verification of their student status. This year, students at the collegiate level will not be eligible.</p></li>
 <li><p class=""><strong>Requirements of artwork to be submitted</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <ol data-rte-list="default">
   <li><p class="">All artwork submitted to the Anthrocon Children’s Art Competition must feature “anthropomorphic” or animal characters.&nbsp; The style of the characters is open to interpretation. This means they can be of a cartoon form, realistic in design, or of a level anywhere in between.&nbsp; Also, the characters can be of a true animal form, a mythical animal form, or a completely original animal creation or hybrid between animals.</p></li>
   <li><p class="">The artwork should be related to or incorporate the convention’s theme.&nbsp; This year, the convention theme is “Aesop’s Fables”. This can be a classic and literal interpretation or it can be a modern interpretation.</p></li>
   <li><p class="">The artwork must be done solely by the student, without outside help in the execution of the artwork.&nbsp; We realize that very young students may need some help with reading fables or understanding the stories and meanings.&nbsp; This is acceptable. However, all drawings, sketches, or other activities involved with the creation of the artwork must be done by the child alone.&nbsp; The goal is to allow each child’s artistic strength and vision to be seen. Even a very young child can create something that may move the judges, so please allow the student to do their own work.</p></li>
   <li><p class="">Almost any artistic medium may be used, so long as it is fairly rugged and can be displayed without means of an electronic display. Examples would include but are not limited to: pencil, ink, pastel, watercolor, paint, crayon, finger painting, hardened polymer clay, fired natural clay, paper-m&acirc;ch&eacute;, fabric, artificial fur, acrylic or other plastic, needlepoint, and other creative materials. Because of the risk of damage, please do not use soft/raw clay, glass, slate, or other fragile materials. Digital drawings or paintings created on a computer or tablet may also be entered, although they would later need to be printed if chosen for public display.</p></li>
   <li><p class="">All submissions must be of appropriate content for “all ages” viewing.&nbsp; Any artwork showing excessive violence, or images of a graphic nature will be disqualified.</p></li>
  </ol></li>
 <li><p class=""><strong>All artwork should be submitted with the following information</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <ol data-rte-list="default">
   <li><p class="">The student’s name</p></li>
   <li><p class="">The student’s age</p></li>
   <li><p class="">The student’s grade and art teacher (if available)</p></li>
   <li><p class="">The student’s school</p></li>
   <li><p class="">The title of the art piece (if applicable)</p></li>
   <li><p class="">Contact information (parent, teacher, or school administrator)This information should be written on a label affixed to the back of flat artwork, or on a card tied securely to 3-D artwork.</p></li>
  </ol></li>
 <li><p class=""><strong>The deadline for submissions will be June 1, 2020</strong>. &nbsp; A digital scan or image of the artwork must be received by Anthrocon by 11:59 pm on June 1, 2020, at the following e-mail address:&nbsp; Childrens_Art_Show@anthrocon.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li>
 <li><p class=""><strong>Judging</strong>: &nbsp; Art may be judged based on many factors including, but not limited to:&nbsp; concept, character design, overall execution, color usage, originality and imagination, complexity, implementation of the annual theme.&nbsp; Members of the Anthrocon Board of Directors will make the final decisions on the top pieces of artwork.</p></li>
 <li><p class=""><strong>Artwork display</strong>:&nbsp; Anthrocon hopes to be able to display as much of the submitted artwork as possible.&nbsp; If the number of submitted pieces exceeds the space available for the Art Display, then a variety of pieces, including the top selections will be displayed.&nbsp; The location of this display will be determined and announced as the convention approaches. The physical artwork for public display will need to be delivered to the Art Show representatives at the David Lawrence Convention Center on Thursday, July 2 or Friday, July 3, 2020.&nbsp; To safeguard against damage in handling and display, the artwork should be protected in some way. Flat artwork (drawings, paintings, digital prints, etc.) should be mounted on an art matte or placed in a print protector sleeve, with a backing board. 3-D artwork (sculpture, jewelry, papier-mache, etc.) should be packed in a sturdy cardboard box with cushioning materials, and identifying labels (see 3, above) attached to both the artwork and the box.</p></li>
 <li><p class=""><strong>Winners</strong>:&nbsp; Winners will be announced at the convention.&nbsp; Anthrocon will provide more details about the announcement of the winners closer to the convention date.</p></li>
 <li><p class="">The submitted physical artwork will become the property of Anthrocon, but the copyright of the artwork will be retained by the student, with Anthrocon and VisitPITTSBURGH granted permission in perpetuity to publish (either in print or electronic form) any artwork images for promotional or similar use without compensation. Anthrocon and visitPittsburgh will make every effort to return the physical artwork after the convention if so requested, but this may not be possible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="">Anthrocon is very excited to support the children’s art community in the city of Pittsburgh.&nbsp; It is our hope that this is yet another bond forming between our convention and the amazing city that has become our host.&nbsp; We look forward to seeing the amazing creations of the children of Pittsburgh, and eagerly await returning in July 2020!</p>
